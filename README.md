# Mustapha Muhammed Botchway

My name is Mustapha Muhammed Botchway and I am a graduate student at GVSU, pursuing my Masters Degree in Applied Computer Science. 
I am looking forward to doing my Master's capstone next semester building a web application and currently brainstorming for a project idea. 

You might be wondering why I have the **_Golden Gate Bridge_** featured here and that's because I consider San Francisco home and where I am working very hard to land and work at. 

## Technical Background
I have technical skills in programming languages like
- **Python**: I had the chance to work on interesting programming projects in **_python_** under **Dr. Jagadeesh** when I sat in his CIS500 class and I find those projects very challenging, interesting and creative.
I have also used python to practice the basics of data manipulation like reading data from an excel file using pandas, cleaning data and training data and finally making predications
- **Javascript**: I am very fond of using **_JavaScript_** as it gives you the ability to build almost any application ranging from Mobile App, Web App and Desktop App. I have developed a mobile app when I sat in **Dr. Engelsma's** class for CIS657 (Mobile Application Development) and that was an interesting project. I also know how to spin an express server and build a backend.
- **PHP**: **_PHP_** is one of the early programming language that I learned before developing my love to Javascript. I have developed some apps with PHP back in the day and I am grateful for my journey and all the experiences that I have had so far.

### Passion outside Tech and Studies
* **_Cornhole_**: I got introduced to the game of corn hole by Campus Ministry (CM) this summer when I started hanging out with them and I am grateful for the wonderful time and experience that I had with them over the summer.
* **_Pickle Ball_**: Two random white American girls introduced me to Pickle Ball when I went over to the tennis court at Allendale to practice tennis for the first time with friend and since then, I have been looking for Americans to smoke at Pickle Ball.
* **_Sky Diving_**: Sky Diving is something that I am looking forward to trying to help me knock my fear of heights out of me.
